# Nova audit tooling bootstrap

This directory is populated dynamically. Run
`python scripts/bootstrap_audit_tools.py` to download cosign and related
utilities before invoking `scripts/verify_vault.py`.

- `cosign.json` contains the version, download URL, and expected SHA256 digest.
- `paths.env` is generated by the bootstrap script so `verify_vault` can extend
  `PATH` without requiring global installs.
- The downloaded executables (for example `cosign.exe`) are gitignored to keep
  the repository lightweight.
