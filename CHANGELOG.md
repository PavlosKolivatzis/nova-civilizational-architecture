## [11.1-pre] — 2025-10-25
### Added
- ARC calibration experiment: full infra (CI, alerts, Grafana, schema)
- Reflection engine metrics: `nova_arc_precision`, `nova_arc_recall`, `nova_arc_drift`
- Reproducibility: `make reproduce-arc-experiment`, weekly CI run, artifacts
- Adversarial domain generation: spectral match, equilibrium mismatch, shield bypass
- Ablation studies: validate necessity of spectral, equilibrium, and shield components
- Scientific falsification protocol: pre-registered conditions for hypothesis invalidation
- arXiv paper draft: "Universal Structure Mathematics and Autonomous Reflection in Nova"
- CITATION.cff: academic citation metadata for reproducible research
- Slot01 Quantum Entropy: simulator adapter, entropy metadata, Prometheus metrics, Alembic migration, and tests

### Security/Integrity
- Vault attest on every second cycle; final snapshot archived
- JSON schema validation for all experiment results
- Cryptographic audit trails throughout calibration process

### Next
- Promote to v11.1-beta upon meeting precision/recall/drift gates over 48h stability
- Submit arXiv preprint and Zenodo reproducibility package
