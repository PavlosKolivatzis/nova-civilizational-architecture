# Changelog

All notable changes to the Nova Civilizational Architecture project will be documented in this file.

## [Phase 3] – 2025-09-16

### 🎯 MILESTONE: First Fully Processual Nova System
- **ALL 10 SLOTS PROCESSUAL (4.0)** — Historic achievement unlocked ⭐
- **System maturity: 3.7 → 4.0/4.0** — Perfect autonomous operation score
- **Total tests: 506 passing** (+345 from previous baseline)
- **New processual tests: +39** for autonomous capabilities

### Added
- **Slot 4 TRI Engine**: Upgraded to Processual (4.0) with 7 specialized tests
  - Drift/surge detection with O(1) rolling statistics
  - Safe-mode with monotonic timing and auto-expiry
  - Snapshot & verification with Bayesian confidence intervals
- **Slot 8 Memory Lock & IDS**: Upgraded to Processual (4.0) with 23 specialized tests
  - MTTR ≤5s autonomous recovery guarantee
  - Quarantine system with ≤1s activation and read-only continuity
  - Adaptive entropy monitoring with frozen baseline methodology
  - IDS write-surge detection with autonomous threat response
- **Slot 10 Civilizational Deployment**: Upgraded to Processual (4.0) with 9 specialized tests
  - Gatekeeper with live health feed integration
  - CanaryController with promotion velocity guards
  - Cross-slot SnapshotBackout with MTTR validation
  - Prometheus metrics export and HMAC-SHA256 audit trails

### Enhanced
- **ACL Registry**: Added `DEPLOY/*` capabilities for autonomous deployment governance
- **Documentation**: Updated maturity matrix, README badges, architecture overview
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics export and hash-chained audit logging
- **Testing**: Weekly chaos engineering with deterministic breach injection

### Technical Improvements
- **Frozen Baseline Methodology**: Prevents threshold drift during autonomous operations
- **Progressive Autonomous Deployment**: Civilizational-scale deployment automation
- **O(1) Adaptive Detection**: Scalable anomaly detection with constant-time complexity
- **Cross-Slot Coordination**: Autonomous state management and recovery coordination
