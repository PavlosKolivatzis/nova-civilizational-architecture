feat(anr): Phase 5.1 — production-grade Adaptive Neural Routing

Implements complete Adaptive Neural Routing system with enterprise-grade
operational excellence and bulletproof multi-process safety.

## Core Implementation
- LinUCB contextual bandit with shadow learning
- Routes: R1 (deterministic), R2 (consensus), R3 (fast), R4 (guardrail)
- Cross-platform file locking (Windows msvcrt + Unix fcntl)
- Atomic writes with crash safety and state persistence

## Production Tooling
- Zero-touch daily auto-promotion with comprehensive gates
- PowerShell 5.1 compatible orchestration scripts
- Automated ledger rotation with compression (100MB/30 days)
- State backup with retention management (7 days)

## Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics with build provenance (git SHA + timestamp)
- Health gate validation for critical slots (04/08_lock/09/10)
- Complete audit trails with environment snapshots
- NDJSON decision ledger for analysis and reporting

## Safety & Recovery
- Progressive rollout stages: 10% -> 25% -> 50% -> 75% -> 100%
- Promotion gates: RSI >= 0.85, rollbacks <= 0.1/1k, TRI >= 0
- One-command rollback with immediate R4 guardrail
- Disaster recovery procedures with automated state restoration

## Operational Excellence
- Complete runbooks with emergency procedures
- Weekly DR drills and chaos testing protocols
- Build traceability with git commits in all receipts
- Professional on-call documentation with one-click SOPs

Ready for production deployment with zero-touch automation.
