abstract: >
  Developed collaboratively by the Nova Team, Phase 11 establishes a mathematical and analytical
  framework for detecting universal systemic patterns through spectral graph theory and equilibrium dynamics.
  Phase 11B adds the ARC (Autonomous Reflection Cycle), enabling Nova to measure and improve its own analytical accuracy
  through self-calibration and meta-learning.
