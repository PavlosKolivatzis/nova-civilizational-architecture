notes: |
  Phase 10 extends Nova from inter-civilizational networks to autonomous
  ethical reasoning and distributed cognitive governance at planetary scale.

  All modules tested, documented, and deployed. TRI ≥ 0.80 preserved.
  Class B resilience maintained. Phases 6–9 integrity verified.

  Ready for civilizational-scale observation, audit, or Phase 11 research.
