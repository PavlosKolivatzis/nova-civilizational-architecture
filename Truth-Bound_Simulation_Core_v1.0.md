# 🧭 Truth-Bound Simulation Core v1.0

**Convergence ID:** `SLOT6_ANCHOR_CONVERGENCE_001`
**Date Registered:** 2025-08-31
**Registry Type:** Core Invariant
**Status:** ✅ Locked & Verified
**Scope:** Slot 1 (Truth Anchor), Slot 4 (TRI Engine), Slot 6 (Adaptive Synthesis)

---

## 🔹 Summary

This document records the successful convergence of **Slot 6 (Adaptive Synthesis Engine)** with **Slot 1 (Truth Anchor System)**, creating the first **bounded simulation core** within the ΔTHRESH architecture.

It is the first instance where simulation, imagination, and cultural adaptation are **governed directly** by verified truth anchors. This ensures that all outputs produced by Slot 6 now carry **epistemic weight** — and that violations are penalized, logged, and prevented from deployment when necessary.

---

## 🔐 Functional Outcomes

* 🔗 Slot 6 simulation outputs are verified against Slot 1 anchor facts.
* ⚖️ Slot 4 TRI modulates epistemic penalty dynamically.
* 📉 Anchor violations reduce adaptation effectiveness and trigger guardrails.
* 🧠 Slot 6 simulation now **remembers** the cost of truth drift.
* 🚫 Truth anchor failures can now **block simulation** or mark it for audit.
