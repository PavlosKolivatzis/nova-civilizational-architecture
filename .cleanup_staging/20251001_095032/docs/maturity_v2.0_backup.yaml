slots:
  slot1:
    name: "Truth Anchor"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Advanced truth anchoring system (822 LOC, 5 files). Enhanced engine with cryptographic
      RealityLock, orchestrator adapters, comprehensive health monitoring. Production-ready
      with async processing, integrity validation, and failover mechanisms.

  slot2:
    name: "ΔTHRESH Integration Manager"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Massive implementation (1,851 LOC, 25 files). Complete ΔΣΘΩ pattern detection,
      TRI calculation engine, enhanced subsystems, performance tracking, comprehensive
      configuration management. Fully processual with adaptive capabilities.

  slot3:
    name: "Emotional Matrix Safety"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Sophisticated emotional processing system (1,008 LOC, 8 files). Enhanced engine with
      escalation manager, threat classification, cross-slot routing, Unicode normalization,
      negation handling, intensifier systems. Production-grade safety and monitoring.
    previous_score: 2
    gap_analysis: "CRITICAL: Was severely underestimated at 65 LOC/2.0 - actual 1,008 LOC/4.0"

  slot4:
    name: "TRI Engine"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Solid TRI processing foundation (286 LOC, 4 files). Core engine with IDS integration,
      wisdom processing capabilities. Structural implementation complete but lacks
      full adaptive processing for Processual level.

  slot5:
    name: "Constellation Navigation"
    score: 3.5
    level: "Structural+"
    rationale: >
      Substantial constellation system (601 LOC, 5 files). Navigation engine with routing
      logic, constellation metadata management. Moving toward Processual with significant
      architecture but needs adaptive processing completion.
    previous_score: 2
    gap_analysis: "Major underestimation - was rated 53 LOC/2.0, actual 601 LOC/3.5"

  slot6:
    name: "Adaptive Synthesis Engine"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Production-hardened multicultural synthesis (1,811 LOC, 11 files). Complete engine
      with context-aware synthesis, legacy retirement strategy, comprehensive CI workflow,
      contract governance. Fully adaptive and processual.

  slot7:
    name: "Production Controls"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Comprehensive production control system (1,773 LOC, 7 files). Context publisher,
      breaker patterns, pressure monitoring, resource status tracking. Full semantic
      mirror integration with operational excellence patterns.
    previous_score: 2
    gap_analysis: "MASSIVE GAP: Was rated 53 LOC/2.0 - actual 1,773 LOC/4.0"

  slot8:
    name: "Memory Lock & IDS Protection"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Solid memory protection system (471 LOC, 3 files). IDS protection, lock guards,
      memory tampering detection. Effective structural implementation but missing
      adaptive recovery loops for full Processual level.

  slot9:
    name: "Distortion Protection"
    score: 4
    level: "Processual"
    rationale: >
      Production-ready Hybrid API v3.1.0 (1,626 LOC, 3 files). Enterprise-grade
      distortion detection, IDS integration, Slot 10 interoperability, comprehensive
      policy management. Fully adaptive and processual.

  slot10:
    name: "Deployment & Modeling"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Robust deployment infrastructure (265 LOC, 5 files). Deployment orchestration,
      MLS integration, modeling utilities, phase space management. Strong structural
      foundation but needs process-adaptive capabilities.

    structural_3_x: 3    # Slots 4,8,10 + Slot 5 at 3.5
    relational_2_0: 0    # None - all slots beyond basic integration
