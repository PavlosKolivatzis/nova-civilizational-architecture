computation:
  formula: "CSI = 0.3 × P6_stability + 0.3 × P7_stability + 0.4 × correlation"
  inputs:
    - phase_6_stability: "Stability from Phase 6 (placeholder: 0.85, future: from sealed archives)"
    - phase_7_stability: "Average memory stability from recent RC attestations"
    - correlation: "min(P6_stability, P7_stability)"
  weights:
    phase_6: 0.3
    phase_7: 0.3
    correlation: 0.4
