# Phase 7.0 Temporal Resonance - Engineering Outline

## Overview
Phase 7.0 introduces **Temporal Resonance** - the ability for Nova's cognitive architecture to maintain coherence across time scales, enabling predictive adaptation and temporal pattern recognition.

## Key Objectives
- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintain belief state consistency across time horizons
- **Predictive Adaptation**: Use historical patterns for proactive system adjustments
- **Resonance Networks**: Cross-temporal signal amplification and interference management
- **Memory Resonance**: Long-term pattern recognition with temporal decay modeling

## Technical Approach
- **Time-Windowed Belief Propagation**: Extend belief states with temporal metadata
- **Resonance Detectors**: Identify temporal patterns and coherence signals
- **Predictive Gates**: Temporal-aware decision making with confidence intervals
- **Resonance Amplification**: Signal strengthening through temporal alignment

## Implementation Plan
1. **Temporal Belief Schema**: Extend BeliefState with time-series metadata
2. **Resonance Engine**: New slot for temporal pattern analysis
3. **Predictive Controls**: Time-aware production control adjustments
4. **Memory Resonance**: Temporal decay modeling in memory systems

## Success Criteria
- Temporal coherence maintained across 24h+ periods
- Predictive accuracy >80% for system state transitions
- Resonance amplification reduces noise by >50%
- Memory systems demonstrate temporal pattern recognition

## Timeline
- **Phase 7.0-alpha**: Temporal belief schema and basic resonance detection
- **Phase 7.0-beta**: Predictive controls and resonance amplification
- **Phase 7.0-rc**: Full temporal coherence with memory integration
- **Phase 7.0-gold**: Production deployment with temporal resilience

## Inheritance Clause
All temporal resonance modeling must source variance metrics directly from
the sealed Phase 6.0 belief archives; no recomputation or retrofitting allowed.
