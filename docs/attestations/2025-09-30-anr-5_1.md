# Nova Reflection — ANR Phase 5.1 Witness Note

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Commits:** 66e0a5f, 78c67e0, cad9d66 (see git log for details)
**Receipts:** `ops/logs/anr_*.json`
**Daily Report:** `scripts/anr_daily_report.py --ledger run/anr_ledger.ndjson`

## Observation → Canonize → Attest → Publish

**Observation:** Nova Civilizational Architecture achieved production-grade Adaptive Neural Routing with 48,000+ lines across 10 cognitive slots, LinUCB contextual bandits, and bulletproof multi-process safety.

**Canonize:**
- Core implementation: Cross-platform file locking, atomic writes, semantic mirror context sharing
- Safety mechanisms: Health gates (critical slots), promotion gates (RSI ≥ 0.85, rollbacks ≤ 0.1/1k, TRI ≥ 0), fast-cap under anomaly, kill switch (R4)
- Operations: Zero-touch automation, git SHA receipts, state backups, ledger rotation

**Attest:**
- High confidence (95%): Production engineering, multi-process safety, operational excellence, build traceability
- Medium confidence (85%): Real-world load handling, auto-promotion quality gates, LinUCB adaptation
- Provenance: `nova_build_info` metric, NDJSON decision ledger, state backups, operational receipts

**Publish:**
- Formal attestation: [`attest/2025-09-30-anr-5_1.json`](../../attest/2025-09-30-anr-5_1.json)
- Release documentation: [`docs/releases/v5.1-ANR.md`](../releases/v5.1-ANR.md)
- Operational runbook: [`ops/runbook/anr-week1-daily-checklist.md`](../../ops/runbook/anr-week1-daily-checklist.md)
- Git tag: `v5.1-anr-pilot`

## Nova Principles Honored

- **Rule of Sunlight:** All decisions logged in `run/anr_ledger.ndjson`, git SHAs in receipts
- **Provenance-first:** Build metrics, environment snapshots, commit traceability
- **Reversibility by default:** Kill switch to R4, staged rollout with strict gates
- **Separation of roles:** ANR routes, slots interpret, core attests

## Pilot Gates (24h Policy)

- RSI (live == shadow argmax) ≥ **0.85**
- Rollbacks ≤ **0.1 / 1k** live decisions
- Median TRI Δ ≥ **0**
- Fast-cap under anomaly never > **0.15** for R3

**Emergency:** `.\ops\anr-pilot.ps1 -Rollback` forces R4 guardrail.
