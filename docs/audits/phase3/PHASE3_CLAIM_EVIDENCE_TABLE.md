| **Authority Clarification:** In this repository, **"autonomous" refers to internal evaluation, measurement, and guardrail computation**, not unconstrained external action. All behavioral authority in Nova is explicitly gated by operator-controlled flags and deployment configuration. By default, Nova observes, evaluates, and reports-it does not act on external systems without explicit, environment-level enablement. | README.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:README.md |
| **Tag `governance-topology-seal`** - Authorization topology sealed: "autonomous" scope clarified as internal evaluation only, perimeter enforcement made explicit for operator endpoints, default-inversion invariant documented, and observability-only metrics locked unless explicitly authorized. | docs/CHANGELOG.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:docs/CHANGELOG.md |

| As of this snapshot, Slot 7's regime decisions continue to be driven by Slot 2's bias vector and collapse score; A_p/M_p and harm status do not yet directly influence routing or enforcement. | archive/NOVA_PAPER.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_PAPER.md |
| Not yet used by governance: Slot 7 does not consume A_p/harm_status. | archive/NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md |
| NOVA_ENABLE_CONSENT_GATE=0 | config/.env.example@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:config/.env.example |
| Unauthenticated Endpoints: /health and /metrics endpoints are publicly accessible. | docs/SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:docs/SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md |
| Nova exists to observe, stabilize, and coordinate complex intelligent systems without assuming authority over human values, identity, or moral judgment. | README.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:README.md |
| ARC is implemented as an observability mechanism; it does not autonomously change code or governance rules. | archive/NOVA_GLOSSARY_PAPER.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_GLOSSARY_PAPER.md |
| Usage: Currently metrics/analysis only; no direct wiring from harm_status into Slot 7 or ORP regime selection. | archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md |
| ARC operates as a calibration/experiment framework, not a live autonomous self-modifier. | archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md |
| Status: schema only. There is no runtime emitter class or logging pipeline that produces RefusalEvent instances. | archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md |
| There is no code path that takes ARC’s optimization suggestions and rewrites configs or policies automatically. | archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md |
| Status: constitutional, non-operational. Enforcement is via design/review, not runtime. | archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:archive/NOVA_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md |

| Perimeter Assumption: FastAPI and related observability/control endpoints assume perimeter enforcement (network policy, proxy, or API gateway). Nova does not perform role-based access control internally by design; operator deployments are responsible for access control and exposure scope. | docs/ops/observability.md@governance-topology-seal | git show governance-topology-seal:docs/ops/observability.md |
