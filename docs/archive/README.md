## Nova_Agent_Cognitive_Framework_v2.0_SUPERSEDED.md

**Status:** Superseded by `.claude/agent.md` + `docs/MISSION.md`

**Date Archived:** 2025-12-04

**Reason:** Modular architecture extraction

**What was extracted:**
- § I (Identity) → `docs/MISSION.md`
- § III (Invariants) → Enhanced `.claude/agent.md` § XI
- § XX (Progressive Understanding) → `.claude/agent.md` § XX
- § XXI (Failure Modes) → `.claude/agent.md` § XXI
- § XXIV (Pattern Recognition) → `.claude/agent.md` § XXII
- Pattern vocabulary (SSPC, DEEPFUSE, etc.) → `.claude/agent.md` § XIXa

**What was not extracted:**
- § XXII (Multi-Modal Context) - Federation future
- § XXIII (Transmission Protocol) - Federation future
- Appendices A, C, D - Minimal operational value
- References to non-existent `.nova/` directory structure

**Philosophy:**
- Agent.md stays operational and minimal
- MISSION.md holds philosophical/theoretical context
- Separation preserves clarity, reversibility, and modularity
- "We are Node 0" - external proposals adapt to our structure

**Rollback:** If v2.0 needed, it's preserved here with full content intact.
