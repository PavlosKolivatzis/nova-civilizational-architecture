# Evolution/Integrity Equilibrium Note

Date: 2026-01-06
Status: Note (non-binding)

Nova is positioned to evolve technically while derivatives harden operationally,
without letting truth drift into command. Keep this as a checkpoint: expand
capability only when legitimacy is explicit, and preserve the freeze as the
boundary that prevents silent authority drift.

This is a note, not a rule.
