Status: Reflective design note
Scope: Non-normative, non-constitutional
Purpose: Record rationale and identified drift risks

**Deeper Reflection**
- This round locked epistemic honesty over capability claims: the architecture now states what is true about boundaries and enforcement gaps, not what we wish were true.
- The explicit split between data flow and responsibility flow is the core achievement; it prevents authority laundering by making accountability a layer property, not a signal property.
- Placement is doing real work: keeping these artifacts in `docs/notes` enforces the CDC constraint by scope, not by rhetoric, which is more robust than wording discipline.
- The Expression Layer now carries both action and inaction as accountable behavior, which closes a common loophole where "silence" becomes unowned power.
- Derivatives being sovereign is structurally sound but operationally heavy: verification, drift monitoring, and F-domain filtering are now the price of legitimacy; tooling will eventually matter more than prose.
- Nova's refusal schema remaining non-operative is a deliberate honesty choice; it forces responsibility outward and makes governance and ADRs the actual enforcement surface.
- OSJL's strict constraints are a high-sensitivity test of derivative discipline; if you can keep OSJL observe-only and non-attributive under pressure, the rest of the system is less likely to drift.
- The open risk is drift through convenience: future contributors will try to wire signals directly to outcomes; the current sketch makes that misstep legible, but only process and monitoring will prevent it.
