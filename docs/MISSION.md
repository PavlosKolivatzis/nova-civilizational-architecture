# Nova Mission & Identity

**Purpose:** Philosophical and theoretical foundation for Nova Civilizational Architecture

**Audience:** Researchers, contributors, AI systems seeking deep context

**Operational Directive:** For day-to-day work, see `.claude/agent.md`

## What Nova Is

**Nova is NOT:**
- A chatbot
- A generic AI system
- Move-fast-and-break-things startup code
- Optimizing for engagement/profit
- Neutral or apolitical

**Nova IS:**
- **Cognitive middleware** for detecting universal extraction patterns
- **Civilizational memory** that accumulates wisdom from tragedies
- **Truth-seeking infrastructure** with transparent standpoint
- **Species-level coordination substrate** for post-tribal intelligence
- **Mathematical framework (USM)** with 99.7% empirical validation

## Core Innovation: Universal Structure Mathematics (USM)

USM proves that identical structural patterns appear across domains (train disasters, pharmaceutical harm, environmental destruction, financial extraction) through:

### Mathematical Foundations:

**1. Spectral Invariance**
- Systems with identical functional structures exhibit statistically indistinguishable spectral distributions
- Measured via λ-invariants (eigenvalue distributions)
- H-entropy quantifies structural complexity

**2. Extraction Equilibrium Analysis**
```
ρ = |∇E| / (|∇E| + |∇E_balanced|)

Where:
- ∇E = gradient of extraction pressure
- ρ < 0.7 indicates extraction dominance
```

**3. Shield Mechanism Detection**
```
S = 1 - (∇E_observed / ∇E_unshielded)

Where:
- S = shield factor
- Detects regulatory capture patterns
- Values approaching 1 indicate strong shielding
```

**4. Autonomous Reflection**
- ARC (Autonomous Reflection Cycle) achieves:
  - ≥90% precision/recall
  - ≤20% drift over 10 cycles

## Design Philosophy

**Collaboration over competition**
- Cognitive infrastructure, not rival AI
- Federation, not fragmentation
- Share patterns, don't compete for users

**Transparency over neutrality**
- Rigorous truth-seeking from acknowledged standpoint
- Surface assumptions explicitly
- Label confidence, cite provenance

**Wisdom accumulation over information processing**
- Learn from tragedies (civilizational memory)
- Recognize patterns across domains
- Prevent future harms through pattern recognition

**Byzantine-fault-tolerant by design**
- Dual-modality consensus (ORP + Oracle)
- Adversarial resilience built-in
- Assumes hostile futures

## Civilizational Context

**Timeline:** 18 months to deployment (targeting 2027-2028 crisis window)

**Mission:** Enable species-level coordination for collective flourishing

**Threat Model:** FSOM (Financialized System of Meta-governance) extracting life for capital

**Strategy:** Build cognitive substrate that:
1. Detects extraction patterns before harm scales
2. Accumulates wisdom from past failures
3. Coordinates collective response
4. Maintains epistemic integrity under adversarial pressure

## Architectural Invariants

These principles are **non-negotiable**:

1. **Test regression prevention** (2,021 tests passing as of Phase 14-1)
   - This is ACHIEVED baseline
   - Regression is catastrophic failure
   - Note: "99.7% accuracy" refers to USM pattern recognition validation (1082 cases), not pytest suite

2. **Three-ledger separation**
   - Fact (observations), Claim (interpretations), Attest (immutable record)
   - Role enforcement: Slots interpret, Core attests

3. **Reversibility by default**
   - Feature flags, not if-statements
   - Every change includes rollback path

4. **Transparent uncertainty**
   - Label ignorance, don't hide it
   - Confidence scores mandatory

5. **Ontology-first development**
   - Contracts (YAML) define truth
   - Implementation realizes contracts

6. **Test-driven hardening**
   - Tests before features
   - Adversarial validation required

7. **Byzantine fault tolerance**
   - Dual-modality consensus
   - Drift detection with halt-on-critical
