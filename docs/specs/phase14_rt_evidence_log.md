# Phase 14 – RT-00X Evidence Log

**Purpose:** Track concrete conversations (real or corpus-based) that serve as evidence for the RT-00X archetypes defined in `phase14_extraction_calibration.md`. This file is for operator-facing calibration notes only; it does not change runtime behaviour.

## 2. Usage Notes

- Each row should reference an RT archetype (RT-001…RT-017) via the “Closest archetype” column.
- This log is meant to grow over time (RT-018, RT-019, …) as more real traces and corpus examples are reviewed.
- When this log diverges from the calibration spec, the spec and/or RT archetypes must be revisited before any Slot07 temporal governance wiring.
