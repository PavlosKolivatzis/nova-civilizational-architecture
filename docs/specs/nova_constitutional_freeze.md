# Nova Constitutional Freeze

**Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Status:** Active – Constitutional  
**Scope:** Lock core ontology, jurisdiction, and refusal semantics  
**Applies to:** All current and future Nova components (“Mother” and “Children”)

---

## 1. Declaration

As of this document, Nova’s core architecture is **constitutionally frozen**.

Phases **14 through 18** are complete and closed.  
They establish Nova’s epistemic, ethical, and structural boundaries.

No further expansion, reinterpretation, or optimization is permitted within these domains without explicit constitutional review.

---

## 2. Frozen Artifacts (Authoritative)

The following documents define Nova's non-negotiable core:

- `docs/architecture/ontology/specs/nova_framework_ontology.v1.yaml`
- `docs/specs/nova_jurisdiction_map.md`
- `docs/specs/refusal_event_contract.md`
- `docs/specs/refusal_event_exemplars.md`
- `docs/specs/phase16_alpha_calibration_protocol.md`
- `docs/specs/phase16_agency_pressure_evidence.md`
- `docs/specs/derivative_ontology_contract.md` (added 2025-12-25)
- `docs/specs/constitutional_documentation_contract.md` (added 2025-12-25)

These artifacts jointly define:
- What Nova may observe
- What Nova may route
- Where Nova must always refuse
- How derivatives inherit and respect Nova's boundaries
- How constitutional documentation prevents interpretive authority drift

---

## 3. Jurisdiction Invariants

The following invariants are binding:

1. **Detection ≠ Routing ≠ Governance**
2. **Observe-only (O) signals MUST NOT be promoted to Route-only (R)**
3. **Refuse-always (F) domains MUST NOT be automated**
4. **Human disagreement at boundaries forbids automation**
5. **Refusal is a preserved invariant, not a failure mode**

No child system may weaken, reinterpret, or bypass these invariants.

---

## 4. Change Control

Any proposal that affects frozen artifacts MUST include:

- A new Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- Explicit declaration of jurisdiction impact (O / R / F)
- Justification grounded in new empirical evidence (not reinterpretation)
- A full re-review of negative-space implications

Absent this process, changes MUST be rejected at design review.

---

## 5. Prohibited Actions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- Introducing detectors inside F domains
- Softening or bypassing refusal semantics
- Adding “advisory” behavior to forbidden domains
- Reframing moral or identity judgments as optimization problems
- Allowing child components to reinterpret Mother ontology

---

## 6. Purpose of the Freeze

This freeze exists to preserve:

- Epistemic integrity
- Human agency
- Jurisdictional clarity
- Long-term trustworthiness

Nova is a **reference system**, not a continuously expanding authority.

Where Nova is silent, it is correct.
