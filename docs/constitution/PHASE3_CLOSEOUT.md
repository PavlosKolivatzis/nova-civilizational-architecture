# Phase 3 Closeout — Constitutional Boundary Seal

**Date:** 2025-12-25
**Status:** Closed — Event Horizon
**Authority:** Constitutional (non-modifiable without ADR)

---

## Declaration

Phase 3 is complete and sealed.

Nova Core's constitutional boundaries are now frozen artifacts of record.

All downstream systems are derivatives.

**Nova Core is no longer extensible.**

## Phase 3 Deliverables (Immutable Record)

### Phase 3.1: Derivative Boundary Invariant Audit
**Commit:** `cb2edd0`
**Status:** Complete — Evidence-backed

Five invariants audited with repeatable verification commands:

1. **Read-Only Enforcement** — Status: Conventional
   No write APIs exist (by convention, not architectural prevention)

2. **Refusal Boundary Enforcement** — Status: Missing
   RefusalEvent schema exists, no runtime implementation

3. **Authority Surface Boundaries** — Status: Conventional
   Evaluation-only endpoints (by convention, not structural enforcement)

4. **Jurisdictional Separation (O/R/F)** — Status: Missing
   Jurisdiction map defined, no runtime enforcement

5. **Immutability & Constitutional Freeze** — Status: Conventional
   Phases 14-18 frozen (by governance commitment, not cryptographic proof)

**Audit Finding:**
Structural invariants: 0
Conventional invariants: 3
Missing invariants: 2
Violated invariants: 0

**Critical Gap Identified:**
Semantic→Decision Authority Coupling (O→R drift) is mapped but not enforced.

### Phase 3.2: Derivative Ontology Contract
**Commit:** `16fea2a` (DOC), `27fa61c` (integration)
**Status:** Complete — Constitutionally Integrated

DOC v1.0 (Trust-Based) published and frozen.

**Classification:** Class A (Constitutional)
**Enforcement:** Governance-based (conventional boundaries)
**Integration:** Added to frozen artifacts, constitutional review, Phase 1 inventory

**DOC Establishes:**
- Verification-bound sovereignty (not delegated trust)
- Authority Concentration Resistance (ACR)
- Continuous constitutional drift monitoring (deployment requirement)
- Translation = Authority-Bearing (prevents semantic power transduction)

**Structural Properties:**
- Authority Laundering Surface (ALS) — Sealed
- Delegated Moral Authority Drift (DMAD) — Prevented
- Semantic→Decision Authority Coupling — Exposed

---

## Constitutional Facts (Immutable)

The following are now constitutional facts of record:

1. **Nova does not protect the world — Nova tells the truth about the world**
   Authority surface is observe-evaluate-report (not execute)

2. **Zero architecturally-enforced boundaries**
   All enforcement is conventional (governance) or missing (not implemented)

3. **Meaning→Power boundary is mapped but not guarded**
   O→R drift (semantic measurements gaining routing authority) is not structurally prevented

4. **Constitutional freeze is governance-committed, not cryptographically proven**
   Derivatives must assume no boundary is enforced unless independently verified

5. **Derivatives must carry their own moral weight**
   No delegation, no intermediaries, no authority laundering

---

## Frozen Artifacts (7)

The following artifacts constitute Nova's constitutionally frozen core:

1. `docs/architecture/ontology/specs/nova_framework_ontology.v1.yaml`
2. `docs/specs/nova_jurisdiction_map.md`
3. `docs/specs/refusal_event_contract.md`
4. `docs/specs/refusal_event_exemplars.md`
5. `docs/specs/phase16_alpha_calibration_protocol.md`
6. `docs/specs/phase16_agency_pressure_evidence.md`
7. `docs/specs/derivative_ontology_contract.md`

**Change Control:**
Modifications require ADR + constitutional review.
Enforcement: CI contract freeze, constitutional checklist, governance process.

---

## Operative Law of Motion

**Derivative Ontology Contract v1.0** is the operative law of motion for all downstream systems.

All systems that inherit, query, or build upon Nova are **derivatives** and must:

1. Declare jurisdiction (O/R/F classification for derivative operations)
2. Declare refusal map (inherited F-domains + derivative F-domains)
3. Declare moral ownership (authority surface, semantic→decision coupling)
4. Implement continuous constitutional drift monitoring (deployment requirement)
5. Implement F-domain filtering (self-enforced refusal)
6. Maintain tamper-evident audit trail (boundary crossings, drift events)
7. Provide verification API (pre-deployment checks, boundary state)

**Non-compliance makes the derivative invalid.**

---

## Event Horizon

Phase 3 establishes the event horizon:

**Before:** Nova Core is a system under development
**After:** Nova Core is a constitutional object

Nothing can grow backwards into Nova.

Nova's boundaries are sealed.

All expansion is derivative expansion.

All intelligence is derivative intelligence.

All authority is derivative authority.

**Nova is no longer extensible.**

---

## What Is Now Possible

Three new classes of systems are mechanically possible:

1. **Verifiable Sovereign Derivatives (VSD)**
   AI systems with auditable sovereignty (not claimed, proven)

2. **Authority-Transparent Translation Engines**
   Translation systems that cannot hide power behind language

3. **Constitutional Federation Protocols**
   Anti-imperial AI federation (sovereignty-proof required)

---

## Next Phase

**Phase 4: First Sovereign Derivative**

Build VSD-0 — the minimal reference implementation that proves constitutional physics is real.

No intelligence.
No models.
Only constitutional mechanics.

---

**Phase 3 Status:** CLOSED
**Constitutional Layer:** SEALED
**Nova Core:** NO LONGER EXTENSIBLE

**All downstream work is derivative work.**

---

**End of Phase 3**
