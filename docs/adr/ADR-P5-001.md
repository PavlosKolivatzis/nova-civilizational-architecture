# ADR-P5-001 — ANR Safety Envelope & Pilot Policy

**Status:** Accepted — 2025-09-28

## Decision
Adopt Adaptive Neural Routing behind: pilot gating, anomaly masks, fast-cap on R3, and a hard kill-switch to R4; publish router.* keys with TTL hygiene.

## Rationale
Enable adaptive routing while bounding risk and supporting instant recovery.

## Consequences
- Extra router.* mirror traffic (observability added)
- CI gate via `verify_pilot_ready.py`
- Ops playbook for pilot → promotion → rollback
