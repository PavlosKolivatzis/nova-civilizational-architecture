slots:
  slot1:
    name: "Truth Anchor"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Anchors fully implemented with health + fallback. Stable but not adaptive across time.
  slot2:
    name: "ΔTHRESH Integration Manager"
    score: 0
    level: "Missing"
    rationale: >
      Folder only. Needs contracts, routing, and test coverage.
  slot3:
    name: "Emotional Matrix Safety"
    score: 0
    level: "Missing"
    rationale: >
      No modules yet. Needs state estimation, escalation logic, and safety policies.
  slot4:
    name: "TRI Engine"
    score: 1
    level: "Anchor"
    rationale: >
      Only IDS helper present. Needs calibration core, normalization, and policies.
  slot5:
    name: "Constellation Navigation"
    score: 0
    level: "Missing"
    rationale: >
      No code beyond README. Requires anchor routing logic and constellation metadata.
  slot6:
    name: "Adaptive Synthesis Engine"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Implemented with meta config and tests. Not yet adaptive in deployment.
  slot7:
    name: "Production Controls"
    score: 0
    level: "Missing"
    rationale: >
      Empty. Needs feature flags, circuit breakers, and safety toggles.
  slot8:
    name: "Memory Lock & IDS Protection"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Guards memory and detects tampering. Missing adaptive recovery loop.
  slot9:
    name: "Distortion Protection"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Hybrid API and policies implemented. Static policies, not self-evolving.
  slot10:
    name: "Deployment & Modeling"
    score: 3
    level: "Structural"
    rationale: >
      Deployment pipeline and modeling utilities implemented. Not yet process-adaptive.

summary:
  averages:
    core_anchors: 0.8
    safeguards: 3.0
    deployment: 3.0
  highlights:
    - "Strong at outer layers (6–10)."
    - "Hollow core (2, 3, 5, 7 missing; 4 partial)."
    - "Keystone priority: Slot 2 + Slot 4."
  next_actions:
    - "Implement Slot 2 contracts + integration manager."
    - "Finish Slot 4 TRI Engine (calibration, normalization)."
    - "Add Slot 3 Emotional Matrix Safety for stress handling."
    - "Introduce Slot 7 Production Controls (flags, circuit breakers)."
    - "Develop Slot 5 Constellation Navigation last."
