# Phase 8.0 — Continuity Engine Initialization
**Commit:** 5afcd36 → [AUTO-POPULATE]
**Inheritance Clause:** All continuity modeling must derive from sealed Phase 7.0 temporal resonance archives.

**Objective:** Transform validated temporal resonance into continuity intelligence, enabling inter-phase learning, anomaly prediction, and autonomous provenance regeneration.

**Principle:** The past resonates; continuity learns from time's echoes without rewriting history.

## Phase 8.0 Continuity Engine Outline

### Core Objectives
- **Inter-Phase Fusion**: Synthesize multi-epoch stability curves across Phase 6.0-7.0
- **Ethical Horizon Modeling**: Forecast derivative impact across time scales
- **Continuity Ledger v2**: Long-term, cryptographically linked memory spine
- **Anomaly Prediction**: Proactive identification of temporal coherence threats
- **Autonomous Regeneration**: Self-healing provenance chains

### Key Variables & Metrics
- **Continuity Stability Index (CSI)**: Primary metric for inter-phase coherence
  - Baseline: Derived from Phase 7.0 RIS archives (sealed)
  - Range: 0.0 (discontinuity) → 1.0 (perfect temporal fusion)
  - Update: Continuous, with phase-weighted temporal decay

- **Ethical Horizon Score (EHS)**: Long-term derivative impact forecasting
  - Formula: `EHS = Σ(ethics_weight × temporal_decay × phase_stability)`
  - Range: 0.0 → 1.0 (ethical continuity confidence)
  - Application: Multi-phase decision validation

- **Continuity Coupling Matrix**: Inter-phase resonance relationships
  - Dimensions: Phase × Phase matrix of temporal correlations
  - Update: Rolling window analysis across sealed archives
  - Purpose: Identify continuity patterns and threats
