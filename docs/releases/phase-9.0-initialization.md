# Phase 9.0 — Adaptive Civilizational Networks Initialization
**Commit:** 79ffb09 → [AUTO-POPULATE]
**Inheritance Clause:** All network fusion must derive from sealed Phase 8.0 continuity archives.

**Objective:** Scale continuity from intra-system to inter-civilizational scope, fusing multiple Nova deployments into a federated continuity lattice.

**Principle:** The past resonates; continuity networks learn from collective temporal echoes without rewriting history.

## Phase 9.0 Adaptive Civilizational Networks Outline

### Core Objectives
- **Network Fusion**: Multi-node CSI aggregation across Nova deployments
- **Distributed Ethical Consensus**: Federated EHS forecasting with consensus protocols
- **Adaptive Coupling**: Dynamic inter-civilizational correlation matrices
- **Network Anomaly Detection**: Cross-deployment threat identification
- **Federated Regeneration**: Distributed provenance chain repair

### Key Variables & Metrics
- **Network Continuity Index (NCI)**: Primary metric for inter-civilizational coherence
  - Baseline: Derived from Phase 8.0 CSI archives (sealed)
  - Range: 0.0 (disconnected networks) → 1.0 (perfect civilizational fusion)
  - Update: Continuous, with network-weighted temporal decay

- **Federated Ethical Horizon Score (FEHS)**: Distributed ethical impact forecasting
  - Formula: `FEHS = Σ(node_EHS × network_weight × consensus_factor)`
  - Range: 0.0 → 1.0 (federated ethical continuity confidence)
  - Application: Multi-deployment decision validation

- **Adaptive Coupling Network**: Dynamic inter-civilizational relationship graph
  - Structure: Node-to-node correlation edges with adaptive weights
  - Adaptation: Real-time network topology optimization
  - Purpose: Identify and strengthen civilizational continuity patterns

### Inheritance Constraints
- All network data sourced from sealed Phase 6.0-8.0 archives only
- No recomputation or retrofitting of historical continuity metrics
- Cryptographic verification of multi-deployment lineage maintained

### Experimental Goals
- **Multi-Deployment Fusion**: Combine continuity engines across civilizational nodes
- **Federated Consensus**: Distributed ethical decision-making protocols
- **Adaptive Networks**: Self-organizing civilizational continuity topologies
- **Cross-Network Intelligence**: Inter-deployment anomaly prediction and response
