# Phase 7.0 — Temporal Resonance Initialization
**Commit:** 7e1bb79 → 6df9ca6
**Inheritance Clause:** All resonance computations must derive
variance metrics exclusively from sealed Phase 6.0 archives.

**Objective:** Convert belief variance into temporal decay weights,
enabling resonance-aware decision propagation.

**Principle:** The past is sealed; resonance is learning from
uncertainty without rewriting history.

## Phase 7.0 Initialization Blueprint

### Core Objectives
- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintain belief state consistency across time horizons (24h+ periods)
- **Predictive Adaptation**: Use historical patterns for proactive system adjustments
- **Resonance Networks**: Cross-temporal signal amplification and interference management
- **Memory Resonance**: Long-term pattern recognition with temporal decay modeling

### Key Variables & Metrics
- **Temporal Resonance Stability Index (TRSI)**: Primary metric for resonance quality
  - Baseline: Derived from Phase 6.0 belief variance archives
  - Range: 0.0 (no resonance) → 1.0 (perfect temporal alignment)
  - Update: Continuous, with decay weighting from sealed archives

- **Variance Decay Weights**: Temporal attenuation factors
  - Source: Phase 6.0 belief variance metrics (sealed)
  - Formula: `decay_weight = exp(-variance * temporal_distance)`
  - Application: Memory metabolism and decision propagation

- **Resonance Coupling Coefficients**: Cross-temporal signal strength
  - Range: 0.0 → 2.0 (amplification factor)
  - Adaptation: Dynamic based on historical coherence patterns
