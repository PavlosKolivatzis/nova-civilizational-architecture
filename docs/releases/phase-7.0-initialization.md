# Phase 7.0 — Temporal Resonance Initialization
**Commit:** af35eba → 6df9ca6
**Inheritance Clause:** All resonance computations must derive
variance metrics exclusively from sealed Phase 6.0 archives.

**Objective:** Convert belief variance into temporal decay weights,
enabling resonance-aware decision propagation.

**Principle:** The past is sealed; resonance is learning from
uncertainty without rewriting history.
